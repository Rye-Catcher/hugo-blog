Currently a 2nd year CS undergrdaute @National University of Singapore I developed the habbit of writing blogs when I was still in high school, struggling for competitive programming as well as Gaokao.\nBut later, I was lucky enough to gain a chance to study in Singapore. No more struggling for these two! Nonetheless they did have shaped me a lot. I still remember that night, my dormmates and I came back to the dormitory from classrooms at 11pm, but still discussed all the night around a prime number ring problem on an old-fashioned algorithm exercise book under dim light.\nThe book solved that problem in DFS. And that is my first memory with the algorithm that I used to bruteforce so many solutions later then. Though I barely use DFS now, and I\u0026rsquo;ve lost that exercise book long agon, I still wish I could keep that spirit of learning.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t mind reading my tedious words, you can check my old blog. Basically solutions to some algorithm exercise and naive talkings.\nBtw this blog is powered by Hugo and deployed on Firebase\nI am still uploading some posts from the past onto this new site.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/posts/my-first-post/","title":"My First Post","section":"Posts","content":"Hello World\n"}]
