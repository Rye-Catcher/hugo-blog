      <description>Hi, I am Xiaoteng. Currently a 2nd year CS undergrdaute @National University of Singapore I developed the habbit of writing blogs when I was still in high school, struggling for competitive programming as well as Gaokao.
But later, I was lucky enough to gain a chance to study in Singapore. No more struggling for these two! Nonetheless they did have shaped me a lot. I still remember that night, my dormmates and I came back to the dormitory from classrooms at 11pm, but still discussed all the night around a prime number ring problem on an old-fashioned algorithm exercise book under dim light.</description>
