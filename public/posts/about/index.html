Hi, I am Xiaoteng. Currently a 2nd year CS undergrdaute @National University of Singapore
<p>I developed the habbit of writing blogs when I was still in high school, struggling for competitive programming as well as Gaokao.</p>
<p>But later, I was lucky enough to gain a chance to study in Singapore. No more struggling for these two! Nonetheless they did have shaped me a lot. I still remember that night, my dormmates and I came back to the dormitory from classrooms at 11pm, but still discussed all the night around a prime number ring problem on an old-fashioned algorithm exercise book under dim light.</p>
<p>The book solved that problem in DFS. And that is my first memory with the algorithm that I used to bruteforce so many solutions later then. Though I barely use DFS now, and I&rsquo;ve lost that exercise book long agon, I still wish I could keep that spirit of learning.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t mind reading my tedious words, you can check my <a href="https://rye-catcher.github.io/">old blog</a>. Basically solutions to some algorithm exercise and naive talkings.</p>
<p>Btw this blog is powered by <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> and deployed on <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a></p>
<p>I am still uploading some posts from the past onto this new site.</p>
