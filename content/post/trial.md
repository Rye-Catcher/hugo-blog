*Originally written in Chinese, on Oct 13, 2025*

窗外的观众席 <br>
没有白日的注目 <br>
夜色却漫长 <br>
黑得令人恐怖 <br>

我感到悔恨 <br>
痛苦渗出额头 <br>
却流不出一滴泪 <br>
是心脏已干涸 <br>
还是胸腔本空无一物 <br>

早晨若至 <br>
我仍要去办公室 <br>
而审判已下 <br>
不准入睡 <br>

“何为罪状”我问 <br>
空气不语 <br>
留我在笼中 <br>
咀嚼分秒 <br>


*English translation*

At the dead of night <br>
I switch off the light and lie down<br>
The stifled air<br>
brings charges against me<br>
I can only plead in silence<br>

Beyond the window, the gallery of seats<br>
no longer bears the daytime gaze<br>
Yet the night stretches on<br>
a darkness long<br>
and terrifying.<br>

I feel remorse<br>
Pain beads on my forehead<br>
Yet not a single tear will fall<br>
Has my heart run dry<br>
Or was my chest hollow all along<br>

If morning comes<br>
I will still go to the office.<br>
But the verdict has been passed<br>
You are forbidden to sleep<br>

“What is my crime?” I ask.<br>
The air gives no answer<br>
leaving me in the cage<br>
chewing through<br>
each second<br>
