## Version 1

*Originally written in English, on Dec 15, 2025, at Wahiba Sands in Oman*

Tonight I am writing a poem <br>
a poem of love <br>
to sand  <br>
your yellow eyes <br>
your immense soul <br>
When I am weeping <br>
you look at me, still <br>
listening to it all <br>

Tonight I am writing a poem <br>
a poem of love <br>
to wind  <br>
your unbound body <br>
your wayward roaming <br>
I write my scars on you <br>
You take them with you <br>
to wherever you blow <br>

Tonight I am writing a poem <br>
a poem of love <br>
to you <br>
Night is coming <br>
tender as ever <br>
Stars shining above <br>
that is my call to you <br>

Tonight I am writing a poem <br>
in this vast desert <br>
a poem of love <br>

## Version 2

*Edited on Dec 29, 2025, in Singapore*

Tonight I am writing a poem <br>
a poem of love <br>
to sand  <br>
your yellow eyes <br>
your immense soul <br>
I write my scars on you <br>
You take them with you <br>
to wherever you flow <br>

Tonight I am writing a poem <br>
a poem of love <br>
to wind  <br>
your unbound body <br>
your wayward roaming <br>
When I am weeping <br>
you hug me <br>
listening to it all <br>

Tonight I am writing a poem <br>
a poem of love <br>
to star <br>
your silent burning <br>
your transcendent mercy <br>
Lightyears between us <br>
yet my heart is warm <br>
under your gaze <br>

Tonight I am writing a poem <br>
in this vast desert <br>
a poem of love <br>
To you <br>
