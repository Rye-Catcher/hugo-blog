*Originally written in Chinese, on Nov 27, 2025*

如果我有一双深邃的眼睛 <br>
我要将它们看向这傍晚的风<br>
它的诞生之处<br>
和安眠之地<br>
以及掠过浮世的意义<br>

如果我有一双永恒的眼睛<br>
我要将它们看向沙漠的星空<br>
恒星坍缩的余晖<br>
猎户座边缘的烈火<br>
和无数光<br>
穿越无限个毁灭瞬间的光<br>

如果我有一双温柔的眼睛<br>
我要将它们看向你<br>
宝石般褐绿的瞳孔<br>
我在你眼中的倒影<br>
和沉默的你<br>
在你睡不着的夜里<br>
我会用这样的眼睛<br>
看着你<br>

如果<br>
如果我有一双爱你的眼睛<br>

*English translation:*

If I had a pair of deep eyes<br>
I would turn them toward the wind at dusk<br>
its place of birth<br>
its place of rest<br>
and the meaning of its passage<br>
through the fleeting life<br>

If I had a pair of eternal eyes<br>
I would turn them toward the desert stars<br>
the afterglow of collapsing suns<br>
the fire at the edge of Orion<br>
and the countless lights<br>
light that has crossed<br>
endless moments of destruction<br>

If I had a pair of gentle eyes<br>
I would turn them toward you<br>
gemlike hazel-green pupils<br>
My reflection in your eyes<br>
and you in silence<br>
On the nights when you cannot sleep<br>
I would look at you<br>
with such eyes<br>

If
If I had a pair of eyes<br>
that love you<br>
