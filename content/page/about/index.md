Hi, I am Xiaoteng. Currently lead software engineer at a finance company, mostly working on cloud infra and products. 

I developed the habbit of writing blogs when I was still in high school, struggling for competitive programming as well as Gaokao.

But later, I was lucky enough to gain a chance to study in Singapore. No more struggling for these two! Nonetheless they did have shaped me a lot. I still remember that night, my dormmates and I came back to the dormitory from classrooms at 11pm, but still discussed all the night around a prime number ring problem on an old-fashioned algorithm exercise book under dim light. 

The book solved that problem in DFS. And that is my first memory with the algorithm that I used to bruteforce so many solutions later then. Though I barely use DFS now, and I've lost that exercise book long agon, I still wish I could keep that spirit of learning.

I started writing poems also after I read _"Last Evenings On Earth"_ by Roberto Bolaño.

If you don't mind reading my tedious words, you can check my [old blog](https://rye-catcher.github.io/). Basically solutions to some algorithm exercise and naive talkings.

Btw this blog is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and deployed on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
